# Next.js Blog Application

This application is built using Next.js and provides the following functionalities:

- **Rendering Blog Posts**: Display a list of blog posts to the user.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for specific blog posts using keywords.
- **Filter by Category**: Users can filter blog posts based on categories.
- **Pagination**: Blog posts are paginated for easier navigation.

## Personal Thoughts

While the current version of the application is functional and meets the specified requirements, there is always room for improvement. Here are some areas that could be enhanced:

- **Code Organization**: The codebase could benefit from a clearer structure by splitting components into `shared` and `ui` folders.
- **Component Optimization**: Introducing more functional components and custom hooks can improve the app's reusability and performance.
- **Search & Category Logic**: The logic for search and category filtering can be refined further to provide a smoother user experience.

However, as of now, the application serves its purpose effectively and provides a solid foundation for further enhancements.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
